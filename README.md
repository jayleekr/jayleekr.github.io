## About blog framework

Irrc, I think I forked this repo from some fancy blogger (back then 201X year lol)
And I used this repo for practicing Markdown and writing down some bull-shit posts (hope nobody watchin this)

Basically all you gotta do is just to write down your post on **_posts** directory.
If there are any hierachy in directory manner in the _post, build libraries will create categories automatically.
