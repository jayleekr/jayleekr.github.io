# GitHub Pages Static Website Improvement Project


## Project Information


- Tech Stack: Jekyll

- Target Audience: General Audiences

## 🎯 Project Goal


Systematically improve my GitHub Pages static website using the contains-studio agents workflow: UX Research → UI Design → Frontend Development → Continuous Optimization


---


## 📋 PHASE 1: UX RESEARCH & ANALYSIS (Day 1-2)


### 1.1 Initial Site Analysis


Use the ux-researcher agent to analyze my current GitHub Pages site:


- Map current site structure and navigation patterns

- Identify user journey pain points and friction areas

- Analyze mobile responsiveness and accessibility issues

- Document current user flows with specific problem areas

- Benchmark against modern static site best practices

Output: Comprehensive UX audit report with prioritized issues


### 1.2 Feedback Collection


Next, use the feedback-synthesizer agent to:


- Analyze GitHub Issues for user complaints/suggestions

- Check any analytics data for user behavior patterns

- Review any email feedback or social media mentions

- Identify top 5 recurring user pain points

- Synthesize feedback into actionable insights

Connect this analysis with the ux-researcher findings.


### 1.3 Trend Research


Use the trend-researcher agent to:


- Research current static site generator trends

- Find modern GitHub Pages showcase examples

- Identify viral features suitable for static sites

- Analyze competitor sites in my niche

- Suggest implementable improvements for 6-day sprint

Focus on trends that align with user needs identified earlier.


### 1.4 Sprint Planning


Use the sprint-prioritizer agent to:


- Consolidate all findings from previous agents

- Create prioritized improvement list using RICE scoring

- Break down into 6-day sprint tasks

- Define measurable success metrics

- Allocate time for each improvement

Output: Day-by-day sprint plan with clear deliverables

## 🎨 PHASE 2: UI DESIGN SYSTEM (Day 3-4)


### 2.1 Design System Creation


Use the ui-designer agent to:


- Create modern, responsive design system based on UX findings

- Design these components:
    - Navigation (desktop/mobile)
    - Hero sections
    - Content cards/blocks
    - Forms and CTAs
    - Footer

- Follow mobile-first approach

- Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

- Provide CSS/Tailwind specifications

Output: Complete component library with implementation notes


### 2.2 Brand Consistency


Use the brand-guardian agent to:


- Review and refine ui-designer's output

- Define consistent color palette (CSS variables)

- Establish typography scale

- Create spacing and sizing system

- Document all design tokens

- Ensure cohesive visual language

Output: Brand style guide with code snippets


### 2.3 Visual Enhancement


Use the visual-storyteller agent to:


- Design compelling homepage narrative flow

- Create visual hierarchy for content

- Plan scroll-triggered animations

- Design infographics for data

- Optimize for social sharing (OG images)

Work with the existing design system from ui-designer.


### 2.4 Delight Injection


After UI completion, use the whimsy-injector agent to:


- Add micro-interactions to all interactive elements

- Design creative 404 and error pages

- Create loading animations

- Add easter eggs for power users

- Implement delightful hover states

Ensure all additions maintain performance budget.

## 💻 PHASE 3: FRONTEND IMPLEMENTATION (Day 5-6)


### 3.1 Rapid Prototyping


Use the rapid-prototyper agent to:


- Set up Jekyll/Hugo/Gatsby project structure

- Implement core layout and navigation

- Create reusable components/includes

- Add sample content

- Deploy preview to GitHub Pages

Get live preview URL within 4 hours.


### 3.2 Production Development


Use the frontend-developer agent to:


- Implement complete design system in production code

- Ensure responsive behavior (test at 320px, 768px, 1200px)

- Add these optimizations:
    - Lazy loading for images
    - Minified CSS/JS
    - Proper meta tags for SEO
    - Open Graph tags
    - PWA manifest (if applicable)

- Create maintainable, documented code

Build upon rapid-prototyper's foundation.


### 3.3 Performance Optimization


Use the performance-benchmarker agent to:


- Run Lighthouse audit (target 90+ scores)

- Analyze Core Web Vitals

- Identify render-blocking resources

- Check image optimization

- Measure Time to Interactive

- Test on slow 3G connection

Then have frontend-developer implement all recommended fixes.


### 3.4 Test Implementation


Use the test-writer-fixer agent to:


- Write tests for critical user paths

- Add visual regression tests

- Create accessibility tests

- Implement cross-browser tests

- Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD

Ensure all tests pass before deployment.

## 🚀 PHASE 4: DEPLOYMENT & MONITORING


### 4.1 Infrastructure Setup


Use the infrastructure-maintainer agent to:


- Configure GitHub Actions workflow:
    - Automatic deployment on main branch
    - Preview deployments for PRs
    - Rollback capabilities

- Set up custom domain (if needed)

- Configure caching headers

- Implement security headers

- Set up uptime monitoring

Ensure zero-downtime deployments.


### 4.2 Analytics & Experiments


Use the experiment-tracker agent to:


- Set up Google Analytics 4

- Implement event tracking for key actions

- Create A/B test framework

- Define success metrics:
    - Page views
    - Time on site
    - Bounce rate
    - Conversion goals

- Plan first experiments

Then use analytics-reporter to create baseline report.


### 4.3 Launch Coordination


Use the project-shipper agent to:


- Create launch checklist

- Coordinate final testing

- Prepare announcement content

- Set up monitoring alerts

- Document everything

- Plan post-launch iterations
