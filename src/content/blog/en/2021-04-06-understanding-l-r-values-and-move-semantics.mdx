## Understanding L-Values, R-Values & Move Semantics in Modern C++

### 0. Preface

Before we dive in, let's quickly refresh our understanding of references (&) and pointers (*).

> References (&) store the address of an object located somewhere in memory, just like pointers (*).
> However, once a reference is initialized, it cannot be changed to reference another object or be set to null.

Values can be classified into two types: l-values and r-values.
The definitions of l-values and r-values (left-hand values and right-hand values) come from the C language.

> Left-hand values are expressions that can appear on either the left or right side of an assignment, while right-hand values are expressions that can only appear on the right side of an assignment.

```cpp
int a = 0;  
a; // l-value
0; // r-value
Player player;
player; // l-value
Player(); // r-value
```

This definition has evolved somewhat differently in C++.

> L-values refer to some memory location and can be referenced with the & operator. R-values are anything that's not an l-value.
> L-values persist beyond the expression they appear in
> R-values don't persist beyond the expression they appear in
> L-values reference named variables (&)
> R-values reference temporary objects (&&)

Honestly, even this definition is quite ambiguous, which confuses many people.

Let's take a closer look at l-values and r-values step by step...

### 1. L-Values

L-values are relatively straightforward.

Here's what qualifies as an l-value:
- **Objects that persist beyond a single expression!**
  - Has an address
  - Named variables
  - const variables
  - Array variables
  - Bit-fields
  - Unions
  - Class members
  - Function calls that return an l-value reference (&)
  - String literals

So how do l-value assignment and referencing work?

Let's look at the code and comments below.

```cpp
// All are l-values
int a = 1;                    // global variable a -> l-value
int& function(){              // l-value function is initialized with the address of returned a
    a = 3;                    // a-> l-value, can be assigned  
    return a;
}

int main()
{
    int i = 3;                // i is l-value
    i = 4;                    // i is l-value, can be assigned
                              // i -> 4
    int *ptr = &i;            // i is l-value, & operator can reference it, ptr points to i's address
                              // *ptr is i's value -> 4
    ptr = &a;                 // ptr is an int * type pointer, so it can change what it references
                              // *ptr is a's value -> 1
    int & r = i;              // r is initialized with l-value i's address, so r is an l-value assigned with l-value
    r = 5;                    // writes value to the address r points to, changing i's value (both r and i are 5)
                              // both r and i point to the same address -> 5
    int c = function();       // l-value reference stores its address only during initialization
                              // c -> function's return value after internal stack operation, which is changed a value 3
    function() = 50;          // function is l-value, r-value 50 can be assigned
                              // a's value changes to 50. 
                              // and ptr points to a's address, so *ptr -> 50 is assigned.
    int d = a;                // l-value d is assigned a's value 50
    int *ptr_2 = &function(); // int * type ptr_2 can use &function (function is l-value)
                              // function's return value after internal stack operation, which is changed a value 3
                              // * ptr_2 -> changed a's value -> 3
                              // c's value also changes -> 3
                              // * ptr's value also changes -> 3
    return 0;
}
```

L-value assignment is relatively clear and easy to understand as shown above.

### 2. R-Values

But r-values are somewhat harder to define...

Here's what we can say about them:

- Objects that are not l-values... (contrapositive statement haha..)
- **Temporary values that don't persist beyond the single expression they're used in!**
  - Objects without addresses
  - Literals (except string literals)
  - Function calls that don't return by reference (e.g. int function())
  - i++ and i-- (but ++i and --i operators are l-values)
  - Basic arithmetic, logical, comparison expressions (+,-,*,=, &lt;,&gt; etc, can vary with operator overloads)
  - Enumerations (enum)
  - Lambdas (the compiler treats lambdas/anonymous functions as temporary)

Let's look at some examples.

R-value example 1:

```cpp
int num1 = 10;
int num2 = 15;

if (num1 < num2) // (num1 < num2) is r-value
{
    ...
}
```

R-value example 2:

```cpp
int function();         // function doesn't persist after call -> r-value 
function();             // r-value
int i = 0;
i = function();         // i is l-value assigned with r-value function's return value
int *ptr = &function(); // ERROR!!! Can't reference address of r-value
```

The original C/C++ designers defined r-values as temporary objects, so by default, r-values cannot be assigned to.

But this changed with the introduction of r-value "**move semantics**" in Modern C++ (C++11).

### 3. Move Semantics

Consider the following scenario:

```cpp
//Math.cpp
std::vector<float> Math::ConvertToPercentage(const std::vector<float>& scores){
    std:vector<float> percentages;
    for (auto& score : scores){
        //...
    }
    return percentages;
}
// main.cpp
#include "Math.h"
int main(){
    std::vector<float> scores;
    //...
    scores = ConvertToPercentage(scores); 
    //...
}
```

When `ConvertToPercentage(scores)` is called in main,
this function in the Math class creates an r-value that's a temporary value of `std::vector<int>` type called percentages.
Then it gets assigned to scores by the assignment operator "=".

How would this work in pre-C++11 (before Modern C++)?

When percentages' temporary value gets **assigned** to the memory area created during scores' initialization, it gets **copied**.
Then the temporary r-value disappears as we exit the Math::ConvertToPercentage function stack.

> There's a quite unnecessary process here - the moment when percentages temporary value gets **copied**.

Think about it logically.

If we simply **swap** the memory area storing the temporary percentages result (r-value) with the memory area created during scores' initialization,
since the temporarily created percentages memory area will disappear anyway when we exit the stack, the "**copying**" process becomes unnecessary.

This method of preventing unnecessary **copying** is the core of Modern C++'s r-value references and Move Semantics.

> Actually, modern compilers are pretty smart about this nowadays... Sometimes overusing r-value references can actually slow down the system. ðŸ˜…

### 4. R-Value References (&&) and std::move

R-value references were first introduced in Modern C++ (C++11).
They function similarly to the & operator.

The example below shows referencing basic types using move semantics:

```cpp
#include <memory>
#include <utility>
float CalculateAverage(){
    float average=3;
    // ...
    return average;
}

int main(){
    int num = 10;                           // num -> l-value
    //int && rNum = num;                      // Error!!! num is l-value -> int & lnum is possible
    int && rNum = std::move(num);           // move allows referencing l-value num
    num = 30;                               // changing num also changes rNum (because it's a reference value)
    
    int && rNum1 = 10;                       // OK, 10 is r-value

    float && rAverage = CalculateAverage();   // OK CalculateAverage is r-value
    float tmp_1 = std::move(rAverage);       // tmp_1 is l-value, so it's assigned
    float tmp_2 = rAverage;                  // tmp_2 is l-value, so it's assigned
    float && tmp_3 = std::move(rAverage);    // tmp_3 is l-value, but it's an r-value reference value
    rAverage = 1.0f;                         // changing rAverage only changes tmp_3, tmp_1 and tmp_2 are assigned values
}
```
