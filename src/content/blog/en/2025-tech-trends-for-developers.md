# Tech Trends We Should Watch Together in 2025

Hello everyone! As the new year begins, I'm sure many of you are wondering, "What technologies should I learn this year?" I find myself asking the same question every year around this time, but this year feels especially significant with the rapid pace of technological change.

Over the past year, working on autonomous vehicle projects, I've experienced so many changes firsthand. Watching AI tools evolve from simple code completion to becoming real 'development partners' made me think, "Wow, we're really in a new era now."

Today, I'd like to share the changes I've felt in the field, along with the tech trends we should pay attention to in 2025. I'll try to keep it approachable and focus on stories you can apply directly in practice.

## Here's what we'll explore together
- ü§ñ How AI is really changing our development work
- ‚òÅÔ∏è Why cloud is no longer optional but essential  
- üåê The story of web and app boundaries truly disappearing
- üîí Why security has become so critical
- ‚ö° The real impact of developer experience on productivity
- üìã How to actually plan your learning journey

## ü§ñ AI has really become my development partner

### From a code-writing tool to a thinking companion

To be honest, early last year I was skeptical: "AI writes code? Will that really be useful?" But now it's completely different. I can't imagine developing without GitHub Copilot anymore.

What surprised me most was that AI doesn't just generate repetitive code. It actually makes pretty good suggestions for complex system design too.

#### A recent experience that was really helpful

Not long ago, I had to apply an event sourcing pattern while designing a microservices architecture. After struggling alone, I asked AI, "I have these requirements - how should I design this?" and it suggested a really clean structure:

```typescript
// Event sourcing pattern suggested by AI
interface DomainEvent {
  eventId: string;
  aggregateId: string;
  eventType: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  version: number;
  data: any;
}

class EventStore {
  async saveEvents(streamId: string, events: DomainEvent[], expectedVersion: number): Promise<void> {
    // Optimistic concurrency control logic suggested by AI
    const currentVersion = await this.getStreamVersion(streamId);
    if (currentVersion !== expectedVersion) {
      throw new ConcurrencyError('Stream version mismatch');
    }
    
    await this.persistEvents(streamId, events);
  }
}
```

Of course, it's not perfect yet. Sometimes it suggests weird code or misses security issues, so I still need to review everything carefully. But overall, it's really improved my development productivity.

#### I think these changes are coming this year
- **AI for code reviews too**: I think we'll see AI doing the first review when we submit PRs
- **Automated testing**: Tools that find edge cases I missed and create tests for them are emerging
- **Documentation is a given**: Automatic document updates when code changes will become standard

### How should we prepare starting now?

To be really honest, I think not knowing how to use AI tools will put you behind. But don't feel pressured! You can approach it step by step:

1. **First**: Try using tools like GitHub Copilot or Cursor in daily work
2. **Next**: Think about "How can I ask better questions to get better answers?" (this is called prompt engineering)
3. **Later**: Build AI-assisted code review processes with your team

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud has really become an unavoidable choice

### From server rooms to edge, boundaries are disappearing

These days when developing, I really feel that "it's getting harder to do things on-premises." This is especially true when thinking about global services.

I really realized this recently when building a real-time data processing system. Users worldwide wanted fast responses, but existing CDNs had their limits. So we introduced edge computing, and the results were amazing.

#### Here's the structure we actually applied

```yaml
# Kubernetes edge deployment configuration
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: edge-processor
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: edge-processor
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: edge-processor
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: processor
        image: myapp/edge-processor:v1.2.3
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "128Mi"
            cpu: "100m"
          limits:
            memory: "256Mi"
            cpu: "200m"
        env:
        - name: REGION
          value: "asia-northeast1"
```

#### Technologies to watch

1. **WebAssembly (WASM)**: High-performance code execution at the edge
2. **Kubernetes at Edge**: Lightweight container management with K3s, MicroK8s  
3. **eBPF**: Kernel-level programming for network/security optimization

#### Performance comparison results

| Deployment Method | Response Time | Cost (Monthly) | Scalability |
|-------------------|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| Traditional Server | 200ms | $500 | Manual |
| Serverless | 150ms | $300 | Automatic |
| Edge Computing | 50ms | $400 | Intelligent |

## üåê The web platform evolution

### New possibilities with Web Platform APIs

In 2025, the web platform will blur the boundaries with native apps even more. New Web APIs like **PWA 2.0** and **WebGPU** are greatly expanding the possibilities of web applications.

#### New APIs to watch

```javascript
// High-performance computing with WebGPU
const adapter = await navigator.gpu.requestAdapter();
const device = await adapter.requestDevice();

const computeShader = device.createShaderModule({
  code: `
    @compute @workgroup_size(64)
    fn main(@builtin(global_invocation_id) global_id: vec3<u32>) {
      // Parallel computation running on GPU
      let index = global_id.x;
      output[index] = input[index] * 2.0;
    }
  `
});

// Direct local file manipulation with File System Access API
const fileHandle = await window.showSaveFilePicker();
const writable = await fileHandle.createWritable();
await writable.write(data);
await writable.close();
```

#### Practical application example
Recently, when developing a web-based data visualization tool using WebGPU, we achieved **10x faster** rendering performance:

- **Before**: Rendering 10,000 nodes with Canvas 2D API took 500ms
- **After**: Same task completed in under 50ms with WebGPU

## üîí Security and privacy enhancement

### Zero Trust architecture expansion

The 2025 security paradigm centers on the Zero Trust principle: **"Never trust, always verify."** The limitations of traditional perimeter security models are becoming apparent, especially with the expansion of remote work and cloud migration.

#### Actual implementation case

```typescript
// Zero Trust authentication based on JWT tokens
interface SecurityContext {
  userId: string;
  permissions: Permission[];
  deviceFingerprint: string;
  locationVerified: boolean;
  mfaCompleted: boolean;
}

class ZeroTrustMiddleware {
  async validateRequest(req: Request): Promise<SecurityContext> {
    // 1. Token verification
    const token = this.extractToken(req);
    const payload = await this.verifyJWT(token);
    
    // 2. Device fingerprint verification
    const deviceId = this.getDeviceFingerprint(req);
    if (!await this.isKnownDevice(payload.userId, deviceId)) {
      throw new SecurityError('Unknown device');
    }
    
    // 3. Location-based verification
    const location = this.getClientLocation(req);
    if (!await this.validateLocation(payload.userId, location)) {
      await this.requestAdditionalAuth(payload.userId);
    }
    
    return {
      userId: payload.userId,
      permissions: await this.getUserPermissions(payload.userId),
      deviceFingerprint: deviceId,
      locationVerified: true,
      mfaCompleted: payload.mfa === true
    };
  }
}
```

#### Privacy-enhancing technologies

1. **Differential Privacy**: Protecting personal information with statistical noise
2. **Homomorphic Encryption**: Performing computations on encrypted data
3. **Secure Multi-party Computation**: Collaborative computation without exposing data

## ‚ö° Developer Experience (DX) innovation

### A paradigm shift in development productivity

Developer tools in 2025 focus on **quality and stability** rather than just speed. Maintenance and scalability have become as important as fast development.

#### Next-generation development environment

```json
// New development workflow configuration
{
  "devContainer": {
    "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/typescript-node:18",
    "features": {
      "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/github-cli:1": {},
      "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/docker-outside-of-docker:1": {}
    },
    "postCreateCommand": "npm install && npm run setup-dev",
    "customizations": {
      "vscode": {
        "extensions": [
          "ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-next",
          "bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss",
          "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Tools to watch

1. **Dev Containers**: Ensuring consistent development environments
2. **Bun**: All-in-one JavaScript runtime and package manager
3. **Biome**: Fast linting/formatting tool
4. **Turborepo**: Monorepo build optimization

## Practical implementation strategy

### üéØ Step-by-step learning roadmap

#### Phase 1: Immediate application (1-2 months)
- [ ] Daily use of AI coding tools (GitHub Copilot, Cursor)
- [ ] Basic cloud service utilization (AWS Lambda, Vercel Edge)
- [ ] Adoption of modern development tools (Bun, Biome)

#### Phase 2: Foundation building (3-6 months)  
- [ ] Container/Kubernetes hands-on experience
- [ ] Apply security best practices
- [ ] Build performance monitoring systems

#### Phase 3: Expertise deepening (6-12 months)
- [ ] Design edge computing architectures
- [ ] WebAssembly utilization projects
- [ ] Implement Zero Trust security models

### üö® Pitfalls to avoid

1. **Technology stack overflow**: Getting carried away by new tech and increasing system complexity
2. **Performance obsession**: Trusting only benchmark results while ignoring real usage environments  
3. **Security as afterthought**: Prioritizing development speed and postponing security elements

### üìä Technology priority matrix

| Technology Area | Learning Difficulty | Immediate Utility | Long-term Value | Recommendation |
|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| AI Coding Tools | Low | High | High | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| Cloud Native | Medium | Medium | High | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| WebGPU/WASM | High | Low | High | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| Zero Trust | High | Medium | High | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| Edge Computing | Medium | Medium | Medium | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |

## Let's grow together in 2025!

### What I felt was most important

Watching all these technological changes, I realized that ultimately, **people** are at the center:

- **AI is a friend**: I think of it as a partner that helps create better code, not a replacement
- **Cloud is fundamental**: It's no longer optional but has become basic literacy
- **Security is a habit**: We need to cultivate the habit of thinking about it from the beginning, not adding it later
- **Slow and steady**: Don't try to learn everything at once; take it step by step

### How should we approach this going forward?

I've planned it this way, in case it helps:

1. **3-month cycles**: It's hard to predict the distant future, so set goals in short cycles
2. **Start with small projects**: Try new technologies with toy projects first
3. **Together with colleagues**: It's easy to get tired doing it alone, so study or work on side projects together

### Last thoughts

It's only been a short time since 2025 started, but so many changes are already happening. Sometimes I feel overwhelmed thinking "Do I need to keep up with all of this?" but I believe we can definitely do it if we take it one step at a time.

Most importantly, I think technology is just a tool, and what problems we want to solve is more important. I hope we can use these new tools wisely to create better services and become developers who help more people.

Let's grow together this year! If you have questions or want to share experiences, please feel free to contact me through comments or email anytime. üöÄ
