## About POSIX

- General
    - Portable Operating System Interface
    - Since 1988~
    - Started with the idea of unifying at least a minimal area since different operating systems use different APIs, causing development difficulties
    - Spec: [http://get.posixcertified.ieee.org/](http://get.posixcertified.ieee.org/)
    - Versions
        - POSIX.1 (IEEE 1003.1-1988): core services
        - POSIX.2 (IEEE 1003.2-1992): shell & utility
        - POSIX.1b (IEEE 1003.1b-1993): realtime related
        - POSIX.1c (IEEE 1003.1c-1995): Thread related
    - Released up to POSIX.1 - 2017
        - Process creation & control, signals, file & directory operations, pipes, C library, I/O port interface and control, process triggers

- POSIX PSE51-compliant API
    - Defined in IEEE 1003.13
    - POSIX Realtime and Embedded Application Support (AEP)
    - PSE51-Minimal Realtime System Profile: small embedded systems, no MMU, no Disk, no terminal
