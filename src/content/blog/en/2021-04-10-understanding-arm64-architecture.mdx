## Definitions

### ARM's definitions when introducing 64-bit support

- **AArch32** – The legacy 32-bit instruction set architecture (ISA) defined by ARM, including Thumb mode execution.
- **AArch64** – The new 64-bit ISA (instruction set architecture) defined by ARM.
- **ARMv7** - The specification for "7th generation" ARM hardware that also includes support for AArch32. This is the first version of ARM hardware supported by Windows for ARM.
- **ARMv8** - The specification for "8th generation" ARM hardware that includes support for both AArch32 and AArch64.

### Windows definitions

- **ARM** – Refers to AArch32 (32-bit ARM architecture), also known as WoA (Windows on ARM).
- **ARM32** – Same as ARM above, used in this document for clarity.
- **ARM64** – Refers to 64-bit ARM architecture (AArch64). There is no WoA64.

### ARM data types

- **Short-Vector** – A data type that can be directly represented as 8-byte or 16-byte elements in a vector. The size is aligned to 8 or 16 bytes, and each element can be 1, 2, 4, or 8 bytes.
- **HFA (Homogeneous Floating-point Aggregate)** – A data type containing 2-4 identical floating-point members (floats or doubles).
- **HVA (Homogeneous Short-Vector Aggregate)** – A data type with 2-4 identical Short-Vector members.
