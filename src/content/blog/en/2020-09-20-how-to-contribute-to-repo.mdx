## TLDR
### 1. Fork the repo to your account

### 2. Work on your own copy and write your content

### 3. Build it locally

```sh
$ bash tools/build.sh
Configuration file: /home/jayleekr/00_Projects/08_ADAS_main/_config.yml
          Cleaner: Removing /home/jayleekr/00_Projects/08_ADAS_main/_site...
          Cleaner: Nothing to do for /home/jayleekr/00_Projects/08_ADAS_main/.jekyll-metadata.
          Cleaner: Nothing to do for /home/jayleekr/00_Projects/08_ADAS_main/.jekyll-cache.
          Cleaner: Nothing to do for .sass-cache.
$ cd /home/jayleekr/00_Projects/08_ADAS_main/.container
[INFO] Succeed! 5 category-pages created.
[INFO] Succeed! 6 tag-pages created.
```

### 4. Test it locally

```sh
$ bash tools/test.sh
Configuration file: /home/jayleekr/00_Projects/08_ADAS_main/_config.yml
Configuration file: /home/jayleekr/00_Projects/08_ADAS_main/_config.yml
            Source: /home/jayleekr/00_Projects/08_ADAS_main
       Destination: /home/jayleekr/00_Projects/08_ADAS_main/_site

```

### 5. Check how it looks

Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:4000/` - make sure everything looks good!

### 6. Commit and push your changes

```sh
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Add my awesome contribution"
$ git push origin main
```

### 7. Create a Pull Request

Go back to the original repository and create a pull request from your fork. Write a nice description of what you've added or changed!

## The Long Version (For Those Who Want Details)

Hey there! So you found a cool open source project and want to contribute? Awesome! Here's the step-by-step breakdown of how to actually do it without breaking anything (been there, done that ðŸ˜…).

### Why Fork Instead of Clone?

You might be wondering - why not just clone the repository directly? Well, unless you're already a maintainer, you probably don't have write access to the original repo. Forking creates your own copy that you can mess around with to your heart's content.

### The Sacred Build-Test-Commit Cycle

One thing I learned the hard way: **always build and test locally before pushing**. I can't tell you how many times I've seen pull requests that break the build because someone forgot this step. Don't be that person! 

The build process does a few important things:
- Generates category and tag pages automatically
- Validates your markdown syntax
- Optimizes images and assets
- Makes sure all links work

### Pro Tips from the Trenches

1. **Write descriptive commit messages**: "Fix stuff" is not helpful. "Fix broken link in Docker tutorial" is much better.

2. **Keep your fork up to date**: Before starting new work, always sync with the upstream repository:
   ```sh
   $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/repo-name.git
   $ git fetch upstream
   $ git merge upstream/main
   ```

3. **Test on different screen sizes**: Your contribution should look good on both desktop and mobile.

4. **Follow the project's style**: Look at existing content and try to match the tone and formatting.

### Common Gotchas

- **Image paths**: Make sure your images are in the right directory and the paths are correct
- **Front matter**: Jekyll is picky about the YAML front matter at the top of posts
- **Build dependencies**: Make sure you have all the required gems installed

### What Makes a Good Contribution?

The maintainers will love you if your contribution:
- Solves a real problem or adds genuine value
- Follows the existing conventions
- Includes proper documentation
- Doesn't break anything
- Has been tested locally

Remember, open source is all about collaboration and making things better together. Don't be afraid to start small - even fixing typos is a valuable contribution!

*Happy contributing! ðŸš€*
