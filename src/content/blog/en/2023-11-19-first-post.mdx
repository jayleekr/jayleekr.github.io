I never imagined in my wildest dreams that my first post of 2023 would be written from a hospital bed.

Well, it wasn't from overwork or anything job-related. On my way back from playing basketball at night, I got into a proper head-on collision with a car that ran a red light, and my car (Sorento) was completely totaled - basically scrap metal.

The other driver had his wife in the passenger seat and what seemed to be a coworker in the back seat. He mistakenly thought he had a left-turn signal and made a left turn during a straight green light. Because of that, I, who was cruising nicely in the second lane at 50~60 km/h, had a head-on collision and once again experienced that moment when adrenaline gets pumped massively into your system.

The first time I experienced that phenomenon was when [I saved someone who was trying to commit suicide by jumping](https://news.nate.com/view/20091213n06658?fbclid=IwAR3wZ-IMRg0_tf87h_aEP5yVmKr-hDrBQJWq2eMFh8Jkh3mgcMUnoraOBEw). (Come to think of it, my life has been quite eventful)

Even then, the moment that lady fell from the balcony was etched in my mind like a photographic memory due to the massive adrenaline rush, and those split seconds felt incredibly long. This time too, as the car was approaching me, I was gripping the steering wheel and looking ahead when I felt this strange out-of-body experience...

Fortunately, I'm okay, so I'm grateful to be alive and able to blog about it. 
ㅋㅋㅋㅋ

Suddenly need to go for treatment, so ending this abruptly....
