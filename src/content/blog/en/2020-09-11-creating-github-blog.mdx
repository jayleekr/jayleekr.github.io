## How GitHub Pages Works

GitHub provides a web page service linked to your account username. Pretty neat, right?

For example, my GitHub User ID is `jayleekr`. If I create a new blog repository at https://github.com/jayleekr/jayleekr.github.io, then GitHub automatically creates a website at https://jayleekr.github.io/ that's connected to that repository.

This means GitHub (on the remote side) automatically generates a backend web server for you following this naming convention. It's like getting free hosting! ðŸŽ‰

Let's build the front-end!

## Front-end Framework

There are tons of front-end frameworks out there, but to get up and running quickly, I'll use the most popular method: **Jekyll**.

Jekyll was created by Tom Preston-Werner (GitHub co-founder) using Ruby-on-Rails, and it's an MIT-licensed static site generator.

*(Makes sense that the GitHub co-founder's tool integrates seamlessly with GitHub, right?)*

## Step 1: Create Repository

1. Go to GitHub and create a new repository
2. **Important**: Name it `[your-username].github.io`
   - For example: `jayleekr.github.io`
3. Make it public (required for free GitHub Pages)
4. Initialize with a README

## Step 2: Choose a Jekyll Theme

Instead of building from scratch, let's use a pre-made theme:

### Option A: Fork a Theme
1. Browse [Jekyll Themes](http://jekyllthemes.org/)
2. Find one you like
3. Fork it to your account
4. Rename the repository to `[username].github.io`

### Option B: Start from Scratch
```bash
# Clone your repository
git clone https://github.com/[username]/[username].github.io.git
cd [username].github.io

# Create a basic Jekyll site
echo "Hello World" > index.html

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin main
```

## Step 3: Local Development Setup

To test locally before publishing:

### Install Jekyll
```bash
# On macOS (using Homebrew)
brew install ruby
gem install jekyll bundler

# On Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install ruby-dev
gem install jekyll bundler

# On Windows
# Download Ruby installer from rubyinstaller.org
gem install jekyll bundler
```

### Run Locally
```bash
# In your repository directory
jekyll serve

# or if you have a Gemfile
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Visit `http://localhost:4000` to see your site!

## Step 4: Customize Your Blog

### Basic Configuration (_config.yml)
```yaml
title: Your Blog Title
description: A cool description of your blog
baseurl: ""
url: "https://[username].github.io"

# Build settings
markdown: kramdown
highlighter: rouge
theme: minima

# Social links
github_username: your-github-username
twitter_username: your-twitter-username
```

### Create Your First Post
Create a file: `_posts/2020-09-11-my-first-post.md`

```markdown
---
layout: post
title:  "My First Blog Post!"
date:   2020-09-11 14:10:00 +0900
categories: general
---

# Hello World!

This is my first blog post on GitHub Pages. 
Pretty exciting stuff! ðŸš€

## What I'll Write About

- Technology stuff
- Coding adventures
- Random thoughts

Stay tuned for more content!
```

### Add Pages
Create `about.md`:
```markdown
---
layout: page
title: About
permalink: /about/
---

Hi there! I'm [Your Name], and this is my blog where I write about...
```

## Step 5: Deploy

The beauty of GitHub Pages is that deployment is automatic:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add first post and about page"
git push origin main
```

Within a few minutes, your changes will be live at `https://[username].github.io`!

## Pro Tips

### 1. Use a Custom Domain (Optional)
Create a `CNAME` file with your domain:
```
myblog.com
```

Then configure your DNS settings to point to GitHub Pages.

### 2. SEO Optimization
Add to your `_config.yml`:
```yaml
plugins:
  - jekyll-sitemap
  - jekyll-seo-tag
```

### 3. Comments with Disqus
Add to your `_config.yml`:
```yaml
disqus:
  shortname: your-disqus-shortname
```

### 4. Google Analytics
```yaml
google_analytics: UA-XXXXXXXX-X
```

## Troubleshooting

### Build Failures
- Check your `_config.yml` syntax
- Make sure all posts have proper front matter
- Verify image paths are correct

### Local vs Production Differences
- Use `bundle exec jekyll serve` locally
- Check that your `baseurl` is set correctly
- Ensure all links use `site.baseurl` prefix

### Slow Build Times
- Minimize plugins
- Optimize images
- Use `incremental: true` in development

## Advanced Features

### Custom Themes
```bash
# Add to Gemfile
gem "theme-name"

# Install
bundle install

# Update _config.yml
theme: theme-name
```

### Collections
Perfect for portfolios or project showcases:
```yaml
collections:
  projects:
    output: true
    permalink: /:collection/:name/
```

## What's Next?

Now that you have a blog:
1. **Write consistently** - Even short posts are valuable
2. **Engage with community** - Comment on other blogs
3. **Share your knowledge** - Teach what you learn
4. **Customize gradually** - Improve the design over time

*Remember: The best blog is one that exists and gets updated regularly! ðŸš€*
