## CV-qualifiers

### 0. Preface

Let's talk about CV-qualifiers! `const` is for expressing constants, and `volatile` is for expressing volatile (changeable) types.

In the STL, `const` and `volatile` together are defined as CV-qualifiers. [Check it out here!](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/cv)

### 1. Notation

In C++, type qualifiers like CV-qualifiers can appear on both the left and right sides of a type.

Let me show you what I mean:

``` cpp
const int i = 100;
int const i = 100;
```

If you're coming from other programming languages, this might be confusing because `const` is usually written to the left of the type.

In C and C++, both expressions above are correct and identical!

> Here's the key rule: `const` modifies from right to left, and only when there's nothing to the left does it modify from left to right.

Why did they design it this way?

#### Readability Benefits

While the examples above were identical, things get different when dealing with pointers:

``` cpp
const char *const s = "aaa";
char const *const s = "aaa";
```

Both expressions are the same, but notice how we have two `const` keywords mixed in. In the first example, one `const` modifies from left to right, and the other modifies from right to left.

When expressions become complex, consistently placing `const` on the right (right-to-left modification) makes for much better readability.

Think of it this way:
- `char const *const s` reads as "s is a const pointer to const char"
- Reading right to left: "s is const, pointing to char that is const"

This convention becomes especially helpful when you're dealing with more complex pointer declarations. By always putting `const` on the right side of what it modifies, you can read the declaration from right to left in a consistent manner.

### Pro Tips for CV-qualifiers

1. **Be Consistent**: Choose either left-side or right-side `const` and stick with it throughout your codebase
2. **Right-to-Left Reading**: Many C++ experts prefer right-side `const` because it reads more naturally from right to left
3. **Team Standards**: Follow your team's coding standards - consistency matters more than personal preference

Understanding CV-qualifiers properly will make you a better C++ programmer and help you write more maintainable code! ðŸŽ¯
