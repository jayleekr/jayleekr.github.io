## Preface

This post is a continuation of the following post:

- [Remote Debugging Using Gdbserver]()
- I'm also planning to write about VS Code's Remote-Development feature (to be uploaded later)

We'll continue using the environment that was set up in [Remote Debugging Using Gdbserver]().

## 0. Setting up Environment

![Desktop View](/assets/img/04-RemoteDebuggingUsingVSCode/1.png)

The image above shows two VS Code instances, each running Docker containers.

- Host IP: 172.25.125.2
- Target IP: 172.25.125.3

VS Code comes with a built-in Run Extension by default.

This Run feature uses a specific configuration file called *launch.json* to support various languages, compilers, and debuggers for execution.

## 1. Configuring launch.json

Press F1 to open the Command Palette and search for ***launch.json*** to execute it.

The ***launch.json*** file is created inside workspace/.vscode.

## 2. Debugging Running Application

By modifying and adding a few things to launch.json, you can easily debug applications running on the **TARGET**.

- Remove prelaunchTask
    - We assume the ELF has already been built on the HOST and transferred to the TARGET
- Add miDebuggerServerAddress â†’ Enter the IP address and port of the TARGET's gdbserver
    - ex) "miDebuggerServerAddress": "172.25.125.3:2001"

Now navigate to the source code and click on the Run Extension in the left bar.

Click the play button in the top left to establish a debugging session.

- The GDB Server must be in listening state

- The session is connected, but if you don't set a breakpoint, the TARGET application will continue running

    ![Desktop View](/assets/img/04-RemoteDebuggingUsingVSCode/6.png)

    - Toggle breakpoints by clicking to the left of the line number or using the F9 key

        ![Desktop View](/assets/img/04-RemoteDebuggingUsingVSCode/7.png)

    - Once you set a breakpoint, the TARGET execution will immediately pause, and you can trace variables and the call stack at that line
