## The Problem

Ever needed to grab your IP address from a bash script? Here's a quick one-liner that's saved me countless times!

## The Solution

If your ethernet interface is `eth0`:

```sh
$ IPADDR=$(ifconfig eth0|grep inet|head -1|sed 's/\:/ /'|awk '{print $2}')
$ echo $IPADDR
172.17.0.3
```

## How It Works

Let's break this down step by step:

1. `ifconfig eth0` - Gets interface information for eth0
2. `grep inet` - Filters for lines containing "inet" 
3. `head -1` - Takes just the first match
4. `sed 's/\:/ /'` - Replaces colons with spaces for easier parsing
5. `awk '{print $2}'` - Grabs the second field (which is our IP)

## Modern Alternative

If you're on a newer system, you might prefer using `ip` instead of the older `ifconfig`:

```sh
$ IPADDR=$(ip route get 1 | awk '{print $NF;exit}')
$ echo $IPADDR
172.17.0.3
```

This approach is more reliable because it gets the IP of the interface that would be used to reach the internet.

## Pro Tips

- Always test your scripts in your specific environment - network interface names can vary!
- For production scripts, add error checking to make sure the interface exists
- Consider what happens if the interface is down or doesn't have an IP
