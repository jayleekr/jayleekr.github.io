## constexpr

### 0. Preface

I'll be honest - `constexpr` used to keep me up at night! It was so confusing that I couldn't stand it anymore, so I decided to write this comprehensive guide.

`constexpr` is supported in Modern C++ (C++11 and above). The specification of `constexpr` has been evolving as the STL versions progress.

After looking at various lecture materials and use cases, it seems like everyone uses it differently and understands it differently. While the original author of `constexpr` certainly had a clear intention, it feels quite different from the initial concept now.

However, there's one thing everyone commonly asks:

**"How is it different from const?"**

`const` is simply constant - once compiled, the data becomes immutable during runtime.

`constexpr` has a similar intention. Programmers use it to ensure that variables or functions are determined at compile time.

But here's where `constexpr` gets a bit ambiguous: variables or functions declared with `constexpr` can be determined either during compilation OR during runtime! 
[cpp reference c++1x constexpr](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/constexpr)

Let's dive into some examples to explore this ambiguity...

### 1. Regular Example

``` cpp
#include <iostream>
int fibonacci(int n){
    if (n >= 2) 
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2);
    else
        return n;
}

int main(){
    std::cout << fibonacci(10) << '\n';
}
```

Here's a simple Fibonacci sequence calculator.

This code calculates the value at runtime after compilation.

``` sh
$ /usr/bin/time ./fibonacci 
102334155
0.56user 0.00system 0:00.56elapsed 100%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 3324maxresident)k
0inputs+0outputs (0major+126minor)pagefaults 0swaps
```

Since the value is calculated at runtime, it takes quite a bit of time.

### 2. Template Approach

What if we want the efficiency of compile-time calculation? Let's try C++ [Template Meta Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_metaprogramming):

``` cpp
#include <iostream>

template <int N>
struct fibonacci
{
    static int64_t const value = fibonacci<N-1>::value + fibonacci<N-2>::value;
};

template<>
struct fibonacci<0>
{
    static int64_t const value = 0;
};

template<>
struct fibonacci<1>
{
    static int64_t const value = 1;
};

int main(){
    std::cout << fibonacci<40>::value << '\n';
}
```

Using C++ template techniques, the compiler internally generates code and does the work at compile time.

So **fibonacci&lt;40&gt;::value** is determined at compile time.

``` sh
$ /usr/bin/time ./fibonacci_template 
102334155
0.00user 0.00system 0:00.00elapsed 100%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 3388maxresident)k
0inputs+0outputs (0major+125minor)pagefaults 0swaps
```

Since the value was calculated at compile time, the execution time is super fast!

### 3. constexpr

So what happens when we use **constexpr**?

``` cpp
#include <iostream>
constexpr int fibonacci(int n){
    return n>=2 ? fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2): n;
}

template<int N>
struct constN{
    constN(){ std::cout << N << '\n';}
};

int main(){
    constN<fibonacci(40)> a; // Compile time
    //std::cout << fibonacci(40) << '\n';  //Runtime
}
```

``` sh
$ /usr/bin/time ./fibonacci_constexpr 
102334155
0.00user 0.00system 0:00.00elapsed 100%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 3412maxresident)k
0inputs+0outputs (0major+125minor)pagefaults 0swaps
```

Again, fast execution because the value was calculated at compile time!

Here's the interesting part: **constexpr** can be used in both forms.

If I uncomment the line in the same code above, the value gets determined at runtime and takes much longer:

``` sh
$ /usr/bin/time ./fibonacci_constexpr 
102334155
0.55user 0.00system 0:00.55elapsed 99%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 3376maxresident)k
0inputs+0outputs (0major+125minor)pagefaults 0swaps
```

### 4. Conclusion

As we've seen, `constexpr` can be used at both compile time and runtime.

If the `constexpr` requirements aren't met during compilation, it automatically falls back to runtime calculation.

Using `constexpr` gives you the best of both worlds:
- You can have values determined at compile time for efficiency
- You can still use debuggers to inspect runtime values at breakpoints

**My conclusion**: `constexpr` is a technique that shows the programmer's intention that a value *could* be determined at compile time, but doesn't guarantee it will be.

It's like saying "Hey compiler, if you can figure this out at compile time, please do. If not, that's okay too - just calculate it at runtime."

Pretty neat, right? ðŸš€
