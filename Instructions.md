# Claude Code Blog Development Workflow

## Project Overview
Developer blog improvement project based on successful case studies (Dan Abramov, Kent C. Dodds, Cassidy Williams). Focus on content-first design, modern features, and accessibility.

## Core Documents
- `project_config.md` – project goals, tech stack, constraints, patterns
- `workflow_state.md` – current phase, progress, task items, detailed logs
- `Instructions.md` – this workflow guide and best practices
- `CLAUDE.md` – comprehensive PDR with requirements and action items

## Development Phases
1. **ANALYZE** – Read requirements, understand current state
2. **BLUEPRINT** – Plan implementation steps, break down tasks
3. **CONSTRUCT** – Implement features, write code, run tests
4. **VALIDATE** – Test functionality, verify requirements met

## Current Focus Areas
- Typography and readability improvements
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Mobile experience optimization
- Consistent branding and design system

## Documentation Update Requirements
**IMPORTANT**: Update these documents after completing each major task or phase:

1. **workflow_state.md**
   - Update Status and CurrentItem
   - Add progress logs with timestamps
   - Mark completed items
   - Add new discovered tasks

2. **project_config.md** 
   - Update changelog with major milestones
   - Modify constraints if needed
   - Update tech stack if tools change

3. **Instructions.md**
   - Update current focus areas
   - Add lessons learned
   - Refine workflow if needed

## Quality Guidelines
- Follow content-first minimalist design
- Maintain TypeScript strict mode
- Ensure mobile-first responsive design
- Test accessibility with screen readers
- Optimize for performance (Lighthouse 90+)
- Keep detailed logs of all changes

## Task Management
- Use TodoWrite tool to track progress
- Mark tasks in_progress before starting
- Complete tasks immediately when finished
- Break large tasks into smaller actionable items
- Focus on one task at a time
