## Goal  
Develop a world-class developer blog based on successful developer blog case studies (Dan Abramov, Kent C. Dodds, Cassidy Williams). Focus on minimalist design, excellent typography, content-first approach, and comprehensive feature set including dark mode, search, categorization, and multi-language support.

## Tech Stack  
- Language: TypeScript + JavaScript
- Framework: Astro (Static Site Generator)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Tooling: Bun, ESLint, Prettier
- Analytics: Google Analytics 4
- Comments: Giscus (GitHub Discussions)
- Hosting: GitHub Pages

## Patterns  
- Content-first minimalist design philosophy
- Component-based architecture with Astro
- kebab-case files; camelCase variables
- TypeScript strict mode with proper null checks
- Responsive-first mobile design
- Accessibility-first development (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Performance-optimized with lazy loading

## Constraints  
- Lighthouse performance score ‚â• 90
- First page load time ‚â§ 3 seconds
- Mobile-first responsive design
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- GitHub Pages hosting limitations
- Static site generation only (no server-side features)
- **AI Content Policy**: AI must not create blog posts or personal content - only assist with technical implementation, structure, and editing
- **Deployment Process**: All changes must pass TypeScript checks, tests, and automated deployment via GitHub Actions

## Tokenization
