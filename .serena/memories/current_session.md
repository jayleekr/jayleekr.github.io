## Next Steps (Per CLAUDE.md Rules)
1. Check workflow_state.md and project_config.md for current context
2. Address untracked blog posts if needed
3. Follow git workflow: feature branch → commit → PR
4. Run type-check and tests before deployment
5. Update workflow_state.md and memories after completion

## Important Reminders
- AI must NOT create blog posts - only assist with technical implementation
- All changes via Pull Request to master
- TypeScript type-check required before push
- Deployment via GitHub Actions (automated) or deploy-native.sh (immediate)
- Maintain memory state and update regularly
