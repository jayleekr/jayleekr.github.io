## Content Tone Guidelines

### Technical Documentation

**Voice Characteristics:**
- **Direct & Precise**: Clear instructions without ambiguity
- **Structured**: Logical flow from concept to implementation
- **Comprehensive**: Covers edge cases and potential issues

**Writing Style:**
```
✅ Good: "Install the dependency using npm install react-query@latest"
❌ Avoid: "You might want to try installing react-query"

✅ Good: "This approach reduces bundle size by 40% and improves load time"
❌ Avoid: "This is probably faster"
```

**Language Patterns:**
- Use active voice: "Configure the API endpoint" vs "The API endpoint should be configured"
- Specific measurements: "reduces load time by 200ms" vs "makes it faster"
- Imperative mood for instructions: "Run the command" vs "You can run the command"

### Blog Posts & Articles

**Voice Characteristics:**
- **Conversational Expert**: Knowledgeable friend sharing insights
- **Story-Driven**: Real experiences and lessons learned
- **Thoughtfully Opinionated**: Clear stance with reasoning

**Writing Style:**
```
✅ Good: "I've been wrestling with this performance issue for weeks. Here's what finally worked."
❌ Avoid: "Performance optimization is important for applications."

✅ Good: "After profiling 50+ React components, I discovered three patterns that consistently cause bottlenecks."
❌ Avoid: "React components can sometimes be slow."
```

**Language Patterns:**
- Personal experience: "In my experience...", "I've found that...", "After building..."
- Quantified insights: "3 key patterns", "5 performance improvements", "2-week experiment"
- Problem-solution narrative: Challenge → Investigation → Solution → Results

### UI Microcopy & Interface Text

**Voice Characteristics:**
- **Helpful Assistant**: Supportive and guidance-focused
- **Clear & Concise**: Essential information only
- **Positive & Reassuring**: Confidence-building language

**Writing Style:**
```
✅ Good: "Code copied to clipboard"
❌ Avoid: "Copy operation completed successfully"

✅ Good: "Choose your preferred theme"
❌ Avoid: "Please select a theme option from the available choices"

✅ Good: "Something went wrong. Try refreshing the page."
❌ Avoid: "An unexpected error has occurred in the system."
```

**Language Patterns:**
- Action-oriented: "Save changes", "View details", "Get started"
- User-focused: "Your code", "Your project", "For you"
- Empathetic errors: "Something went wrong" vs "Error 404"

## Bilingual Content Standards

### Korean Content Guidelines (한국어)

**Formality Level:**
- **Professional Content**: 존댓말 (formal speech)
- **Blog Posts**: 존댓말 with occasional 반말 for relatability
- **UI Elements**: 존댓말 for consistency

**Korean Writing Principles:**
```
✅ Good: "이 방법을 사용하면 성능이 40% 향상됩니다."
❌ Avoid: "이 방법은 성능 향상에 도움이 될 수도 있습니다."

✅ Good: "React 컴포넌트를 최적화하는 3가지 방법"
❌ Avoid: "리액트 컴포넌트 최적화 방법들"
```

**Technical Terms:**
- Use Korean terms when widely accepted: "컴포넌트", "API", "라이브러리"
- Provide English in parentheses for clarity: "상태 관리(State Management)"
- Maintain English for code-specific terms: "useState", "useEffect"

**Cultural Considerations:**
- Respect hierarchical communication norms
- Use humble language when discussing personal achievements
- Acknowledge community and collaborative aspects

### English Content Guidelines

**Style Standards:**
- **American English** spelling and conventions
- **International audience awareness** - avoid US-centric references
- **Inclusive language** - gender-neutral, culturally sensitive

**Technical Writing:**
```
✅ Good: "This optimization reduces memory usage and improves performance."
❌ Avoid: "This optimization is pretty good for performance."

✅ Good: "Configure your environment variables before deployment."
❌ Avoid: "You should probably set up your env vars."
```

**Audience Considerations:**
- Global developer community
- Varying levels of English proficiency
- Different cultural contexts and work environments

## Voice Implementation Guidelines

### Consistency Checklist

**Before Publishing:**
- [ ] Tone matches content category
- [ ] Technical accuracy verified
- [ ] Cultural sensitivity reviewed
- [ ] Language appropriate for target audience
- [ ] Personal anecdotes enhance rather than distract
- [ ] Call-to-action clear and valuable

### Common Voice Pitfalls to Avoid

**❌ Overly Academic**
```
Avoid: "Subsequently, one must consider the paradigmatic implications..."
Better: "Next, think about how this affects your application architecture."
```

**❌ Unnecessarily Casual**
```
Avoid: "This bug is super annoying and totally breaks everything."
Better: "This bug causes the component to crash and affects user experience."  
```

**❌ Vague or Uncertain**
```
Avoid: "This might work better in some cases."
Better: "This approach works better for applications with more than 100 components."
```

**❌ Technology Evangelism**
```
Avoid: "React is the best framework and everyone should use it."
Better: "React works well for this use case because of its component model and ecosystem."
```
